### 🛠️ Implementation
This is a responsive restaurant menu website that features a home page with a presentation of the restaurant, a menu page where customers can browse through all the menu items (with photo, description and price) and add them to the cart. It uses DOM to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, and update the content dynamically. localStorage is also used to store user preferences, such as customized menu items to provide a personalized experience.
