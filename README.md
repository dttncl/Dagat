# Dagat Restaurant

This is my first website made from scratch using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- localStorage

For this class, the task is to create a responsive restaurant menu website will feature a home page with a presentation of the restaurant, a menu page where customers can browse through all the menu items (with photo, description and price) and add them to the cart.
